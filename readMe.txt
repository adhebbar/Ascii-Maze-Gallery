This is a game where random mazes are generated, with user input images on the walls (after some image processing). 
This project makes use of the external python modules panda3D and PIL (Python Imaging Library). These modules were installed with pip install. 
You can install these libraries by first installing pip, and then using pip to install panda3d and PIL.
